Implement of [E. Bourtsoulatze, D. Burth Kurka and D. Gündüz, "Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding for Wireless Image Transmission," in IEEE Transactions on Cognitive Communications and Networking, vol. 5, no. 3, pp. 567-579, Sept. 2019]
## Version
TensorFlow version: 2.18.0
Keras version: 3.6.0
## Complete List
- The provided code generates a performance plot of the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) for the deep Joint Source-Channel Coding (JSCC) algorithm on CIFAR-10 test images, considering different Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs), in the case of bandwidth compression ratio versus an Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel.
- The code also completes the image visualization under the above conditions.
